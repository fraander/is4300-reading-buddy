## Feedback Plan

We plan to conduct usability tests with the initial version of our implementation by observing parents and their children using the app for a reading session to see how usable and accessible the application is. We then plan to conduct interviews following the test to discuss effectiveness and satisfaction. Observations will allow us to see the nuances of usage while also ensuring we do not interfere with the results in the way a demo would. Additionally, the interviews following the test will allow us to better understand aspects that go unspoken such as satisfaction with the quality of the learning which we will only be able to evaluate from a conversation with parents and teachers.

Given privacy concerns related to children, we want to ensure that we are respectful. Thus, we are unfortunately limited to parents and families who we already know (even if we would prefer to have a larger group).

To conduct our user test, we will first get clearance from the parents and then explain the purpose of the application: to help children become more passionate, independent readers. Then, we will install the interface on their phone (as a web app) and ask them to use it without further instruction from us. We will then observe their first usage with their child. 

Following the test, we will ask if they preferred using the interface to not using the interface or to using any alternatives they have also tried. Then, we will ask the child if they think they understood more of what they read, and if they think it was easier to read than usual. Next, we will ask the parent if they think their child understood more, if they payed better attention, and if they are confident their child could use the reading session feature without direct observation from them. Finally, we will ask them to use the interface independently for a few days. After a few days pass we will ask the questions again to see if anything has changed and if they have further notes or comments which we can use to improve the interface.
